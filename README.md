Petaca
======
Petaca is an ad hoc collection of modern Fortran modules that provide
broadly useful capabilities -- things that I have found myself using
repeatedly across many projects. A unifying feature of the modules is
their object-oriented interfaces and implementation.

See the documentation at `readthedocs.org <http://petaca.readthedocs.io/>`_
(under development).
