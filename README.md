Petaca
======
Petaca is an ad hoc collection of modern Fortran modules that provide
broadly useful capabilities -- things that I have found myself using
repeatedly across many projects. A unifying feature of the modules is
their object-oriented interfaces and implementation.

Read the documentation on [readthedocs.org](http://petaca.readthedocs.io/)
(under development).

The compilers currently supported/tested are:
* NAG nagfor 7.0, 7.1, and 7.2 (recent builds of those versions)
* GNU gfortran 12, 13, 14, and 15
* Intel ifx OneAPI 2024, 2025; also classic ifort from OneAPI
* LLVM flang versions 19.1 and 20.1

Other compilers supporting the Fortran 2018 standard should work as well.
