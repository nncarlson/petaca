!! TIMER_TREE_TYPE
!!
!! This module implements a lightweight method for creating and maintaining
!! a nested set, or tree, of timers.  The tree is automatically generated via
!! the nested starting and stopping of named timers.  Because timers are
!! distinguished by name and position in the tree, a start/stop pair will give
!! rise to different timers when the code containing it is executed within
!! different timer nestings.  As a result, the timing of a portion of shared
!! code can easily, and automatically, be partitioned according to its use.

!! PROGRAMMING INTERFACE
!!
!! This module defines the derived data type TIMER_TREE and a collection of
!! procedures that operate on a private module variable of that type, the
!! so-called global timer tree.  In most cases, use of the global timer tree
!! via these procedures will provide adequate functionality, but the derived
!! type is also provided should application code want to manage its own timer
!! tree objects.
!!
!! The derived type has the following type bound procedures.
!!
!!  START(NAME [,HANDLE]) starts the timer with the specified character string
!!    name that is a child of the current timer.  If no such child exists, one
!!    is created with this name.  This child timer then becomes the current
!!    timer.  If the optional integer argument handle is specified, it returns
!!    a handle to the timer which can be used as an argument to the WRITE or
!!    READ type bound procedures.
!!
!!  STOP(NAME [,STAT [,ERRMSG]]) stops the current timer.  The current timer's
!!    parent becomes the new current timer.  It is an error if the current
!!    timer does not have the specified name.  If the optional integer argument
!!    STAT is present, it is assigned the value 0 if no error was encountered;
!!    otherwise it is assigned a non-zero value.  In the latter case, the
!!    allocatable deferred-length character string ERRMSG, if present, is
!!    assigned an explanatory message.  If STAT is not present and an error
!!    occurs, the error message is written to the preconnected error unit and
!!    the program is stopped.
!!
!!  WRITE(UNIT, INDENT [,HANDLE]) writes the accumulated time for each timer
!!    to the specified logical unit, using indentation to express the nested
!!    structure of the timer tree.  The incremental number of spaces to
!!    indent for successive tree levels is given by the integer INDENT.  If
!!    an optional integer HANDLE returned by START is specified, only the
!!    accumulated times for that timer and its decendents are written.
!!
!!  READ(HANDLE, TIME) returns, in the default real argument TIME, the elapsed
!!    time for the timer associated with the HANDLE returned by START.  The
!!    timer may be running or stopped.
!!
!!  SERIALIZE(TREE, NAME, TIME) returns the current state of the timer tree
!!    in flat arrays.  Timers may be running or stopped and their state is
!!    unaltered.  The allocatable, deferred-length character array NAME and
!!    allocatable default real array TIME return the timer names and elapsed
!!    times indexed by tree node number.  The allocatable default integer
!!    array TREE returns the structure of the tree as a sequence of node
!!    numbers: node numbers appear in matching pairs, like opening and closing
!!    parentheses, with the intervening sequence describing the trees of its
!!    children, recursively.  The nodes are numbered so that the initial node
!!    of the pairs appear in sequential order.  This enables a simple
!!    reconstruction of the tree; see USING THE OUTPUT OF SERIALIZE below.
!!
!!  DESERIALIZE(TREE, NAME, TIME) defines the state of the timer tree using
!!    the TREE, NAME, and TIME arrays as returned by SERIALIZE.  This can be
!!    used to initialize a timer tree with results from a previous simulation,
!!    for example.  Note that timer handles are not preserved.
!!
!! Objects of timer_tree type should not be used in assignment statements;
!! only the default intrinsic assignment is available and its semantics are
!! almost certainly not what would be desired.  Objects are properly finalized
!! when deallocated or otherwise cease to exist.
!!
!! The following subroutines are provided which operate on the "global timer
!! tree" which is a private timer_tree type module variable.  The subroutines
!! have the same interface and effect as the corresponding type bound
!! procedures
!!
!!  CALL START_TIMER (NAME [,HANDLE])
!!  CALL STOP_TIMER (NAME [,STAT [,ERRMSG]])
!!  CALL WRITE_TIMER_TREE (UNIT, INDENT [,HANDLE])
!!  CALL READ_TIMER (HANDLE, TIME)
!!  CALL SERIALIZE_TIMER_TREE (TREE, NAME, TIME)
!!  CALL DESERIALIZE_TIMER_TREE (TREE, NAME, TIME)
!!
!! In addition there is the subroutine
!!
!!  CALL RESET_TIMER_TREE () which resets the global timer tree to its
!!    initial empty state.
!!
!! Using the timers requires no more that calling START_TIMER and STOP_TIMER
!! in matching pairs with an arbitrary name string.  The only restriction is
!! that the timers be nested; starting "A", then "B", and then stopping "A"
!! is not allowed, for example.  Any incorrect nesting of the timers will be
!! detected by STOP_TIMER.  The same name may be used for multiple start/stop
!! pairs, and stop/start pairs with the same name and nesting are treated as
!! a single timer and their elapsed time accumulated accordingly.  Otherwise
!! they are treated as separate timers.  To obtain the total time associated
!! with a particular key, wherever it occurs in the tree, would be a simple
!! post-processing step.
!!
!! The intrinsic subroutine SYSTEM_CLOCK is used to read the wall-clock time.
!! This provides an accurate measure of real time in threaded contexts.
