!! PROGRAMMING INTERFACE
!!
!! This module defines the derived data type STATE_HISTORY (with private
!! components) with the following methods as type-bound procedures.
!!
!!  INIT (MVEC, {T, X [, XDOT] | VLEN}) initializes the history structure
!!    to maintain up to MVEC state vectors.  In the first variant, the
!!    vector X with time index T is recorded as the initial vector of a new
!!    history.  If the optional vector XDOT is also specified, it is recorded
!!    as the state vector time derivative at the same time index T.  In the
!!    second variant, VLEN specifies the length of the vectors to be maintained
!!    but no state vector is recorded.  It is permissible to re-initialize a
!!    history structure that had been previously initialized.
!!
!!  FLUSH (T, X [, XDOT]) flushes the accumulated state vectors and records the
!!    state vector X with time index T as the initial state vector of a new
!!    history.  If XDOT is specified, it is also recorded as the state vector
!!    time derivative at time index T.  This differs from re-initializing in
!!    that the maximum number of vectors and their length are not changed.
!!
!!  REAL_KIND() returns the kind parameter value expected of all real arguments.
!!
!!  DEPTH() returns the number of state vectors currently stored. This number
!!    will vary between 0 and the value of MVEC used to initialize the object.
!!
!!  MAX_DEPTH() returns the maximum number state vectors that can be stored.
!!    This number is the value of MVEC used to initialize the object.
!!
!!  STATE_SIZE() returns the length of the state vectors stored by the object.
!!    This number will equal the size of the state vector or the value of VLEN
!!    that was used to initialize the object.
!!
!!  LAST_TIME() returns the time index of the last recorded state vector.
!!
!!  GET_LAST_STATE_COPY (COPY) copies the last recorded state vector into
!!    the array COPY, whose length should equal STATE_SIZE().
!!
!!  GET_LAST_STATE_VIEW (VIEW) associates the pointer VIEW with the last
!!    recorded state vector.  THIS SHOULD BE USED WITH GREAT CAUTION.  The
!!    target of this pointer should never be modified or deallocated.  The
!!    pointer will cease to reference the last recorded state vector when
!!    the history is subsequently modified through calls to RECORD_STATE,
!!    FLUSH or INIT.
!!
!!  TIME_DELTAS() returns an array containing the time index differences: the
!!    first element is the difference between the last and penultimate times;
!!    the second element is the difference between the last and antepenultimate
!!    times, and so forth.  The length of the result equals DEPTH()-1.  It is
!!    an error to call this method if DEPTH() is less than 2.
!!
!!  RECORD_STATE (T, X [, XDOT]) records the vector X with time index T as
!!    the last state vector in the history.  If the vector XDOT is present,
!!    it is recorded as the state vector time derivative with the same time
!!    index.  The oldest state vector (or the two oldest in the case XDOT
!!    is present) is discarded once the history is fully populated with MVEC
!!    vectors.  Note that when only one of a X/XDOT pair of vectors is
!!    discarded, it is effectively the derivative vector that gets discarded.
!!
!!  INTERP_STATE (T, X [, FIRST] [, ORDER]) computes the interpolated state
!!    vector at time T from the set of vectors maintained by the history, and
!!    returns the result in the user-supplied array X. Polynomial interpolation
!!    is used, and ORDER, if present, specifies the order using the ORDER+1
!!    most recent vectors; 1 for linear interpolation, 2 for quadratic, etc.
!!    It is an error to request an order for which there is insufficient data.
!!    If not specified, the maximal interpolation order is used given the
!!    available data; once the history is fully populated, the interpolation
!!    order is MVEC-1.  Typically the array X would have the same size as the
!!    stored state vectors, but more generally X may return any contiguous
!!    segment of the interpolated state starting at index FIRST (default 1)
!!    and length the size of X.
!!
!!  REVISE (INDEX, X [, XDOT]) revises the history of a selected state vector
!!    component: INDEX is the component, X is the new most recent value of that
!!    component, and XDOT, if present, is the new first divided difference.
!!    All higher-order divided differences for the component are set to zero.
!!    DEPTH() must be at least 1 (2 if XDOT is present) to use this method.
!!    The use-case for this method arises from equation switching.
!!
!!  DEFINED() returns true if the object is well-defined; otherwise it returns
!!    false.  Defined means that the data components of the object are properly
!!    and consistently defined.  DEFINED() should return true at any time after
!!    the INIT method has been called.  This method is primarily intended to be
!!    used in debugging situations and is used internally in assertion checks.
!!
!! REMARKS
!!
!! Oldest/newest refers to the sequence in which vectors are recorded and not
!! to the time values supplied.  Typically, the corresponding time sequence
!! will be strictly increasing; anything else would be perverse.
!!
!! When recording the time derivative (XDOT) of a solution vector, this vector
!! counts as an additional vector when considered by DEPTH() and MAX_DEPTH().
!!
!! IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
!!
!! The sequence of solution vectors is actually stored as a table of
!! divided differences, which is easily updated and which makes polynomial
!! interpolation particularly simple to express.
!!
!! History shifting (induced by recording a new vector) takes place through
!! shifting pointers; vectors themselves are not copied.  The natural
!! implementation would use an array of pointers to vectors, but this is not
!! possible to do directly.  The indirect means is to box up the pointer in
!! an auxillary type (PTR_BOX) and declare an array of this type.

 !! RECORD_STATE
 !!
 !! This subroutine records the vector X with time index T as the most recent
 !! state vector in the history structure THIS.  If the vector XDOT is
 !! present, it is recorded as the solution vector time derivative at the same
 !! time index.  The oldest solution vector (or two oldest in the case XDOT is
 !! present) is discarded once the history is fully populated.  Note that it
 !! is actually the table of vector divided differences that is stored, rather
 !! than the vectors themselves.
 !!
 !! The treatment of the derivative data XDOT can be viewed as recording a
 !! second state vector at a slightly greater time index than T such that
 !! the first divided difference is XDOT, and then taking the limit as this
 !! time index approaches T.  This is implemented here by first recording X
 !! as a new state vector (and updating all the divided differences) and
 !! then introducing X again as a new state vector at the same time index
 !! but with the first divided difference set to XDOT, and then computing the
 !! the higher order divided differences as usual.
 !!
 !! Interpolation using the resulting history works as expected: evaluating the
 !! interpolant at the vector's time index yields the vector, and evaluating
 !! the derivative of the interpolant at that time index would yield XDOT.
 !!
 !! Note that when only one of a X/XDOT pair of vectors is discarded, it is the
 !! derivative vector (which exists in the higher order divided difference) that
 !! gets discarded.
